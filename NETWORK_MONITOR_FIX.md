# WinIDS Network Monitor Fix

## Issue
When running the WinIDS Network Monitor, internet connectivity is lost because the monitor captures network packets but doesn't forward them.

## Solution
The fix adds a single line of code to the `_capture_packets` method in the `network_monitor.py` file:

```python
# Forward the packet to maintain internet connectivity
w.send(packet)
```

This line ensures that packets are properly forwarded after being captured, maintaining internet connectivity while still allowing the monitor to analyze the traffic.

## How to Apply the Fix
The fix has been applied to the `network_monitor.py` file in the WinIDS package. If you're experiencing internet connectivity issues with the network monitor, make sure you're using the latest version of the package.

## How to Verify the Fix
1. Run the WinIDS Network Monitor using the `winids_netmon.bat` script
2. Check if your internet connection is maintained
3. The monitor should now be able to capture and analyze network traffic without disrupting your internet connection

## Technical Details
The WinIDS Network Monitor uses the `pydivert` library to capture network packets. By default, when a packet is captured using `w.recv()`, it's removed from the network stack. To maintain internet connectivity, we need to forward the packet using `w.send(packet)` after capturing it.

This fix ensures that packets are properly forwarded while still allowing the monitor to analyze the traffic.
